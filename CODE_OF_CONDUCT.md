# Image Classification Project Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to the image classification project focused on classifying sports personalities using machine learning techniques. This code of conduct outlines the guidelines and rules that all team members involved in this project must adhere to ensure a smooth and collaborative work environment.

## Respect and Collaboration

1. **Respect**: Treat all team members, collaborators, and participants with respect and professionalism. Be considerate of diverse perspectives and backgrounds.

2. **Collaboration**: Encourage open communication and collaboration. Share ideas, knowledge, and resources to help achieve project goals.

## Data Usage

3. **Data Collection**: If collecting data, ensure that it is done in compliance with copyright and privacy laws. Always give proper attribution if using third-party data sources.

4. **Data Privacy**: Respect the privacy of individuals in collected data. Do not share sensitive or personally identifiable information without proper consent and anonymization.

## Model Development

5. **Model Selection**: The choice of machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), should be based on empirical evidence and justified through experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Document and share the process of hyperparameter tuning to ensure reproducibility. Consider using version control to track changes.

7. **Model Evaluation**: Clearly report model performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Make sure results are reproducible and interpretable.

## Data Sources

8. **Data Sources**: When using external data sources like images from Google scraped with the Fatkun Chrome extension, ensure compliance with the terms of service and copyright laws. Always cite the sources properly.

## Documentation and Sharing

9. **Documentation**: Maintain clear and up-to-date project documentation. This includes code comments, README files, and documentation on data sources, model architecture, and evaluation results.

10. **Sharing Results**: Share project progress and results with the team regularly. Be transparent about challenges and setbacks.

## Conflict Resolution

11. **Conflict Resolution**: In case of disagreements or conflicts, address them in a constructive and respectful manner. Seek consensus through open dialogue and compromise.

## Compliance

12. **Code Adherence**: All team members are expected to adhere to this code of conduct. Failure to do so may result in project-related actions or removal from the project.

## Conclusion

By following this code of conduct, we aim to create a collaborative, respectful, and productive environment for our image classification project. Let's work together to achieve our goals and contribute to the success of the project.
